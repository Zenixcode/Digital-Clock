# Digital Clock

# Steps I took to create it

1) Styling the page
2) Doing the logic of the digital clock

2.1) Get all the elements on the page that I will be changing

2.2) Figure out how to get the current time

2.3) Display the current time on the page

2.4) To make it count every second run the function every second

2.5) Add zero ifthe number is less than 10
# What I learned doing this project

*How to get current time
*Learned more about how objects are useful
*I learned about the importance of where you place your variables or about scope

# Struggles 

I had a struggle with the code not running every second but I figured out that I put the 
time variable on the outside of the function so when I put it inside the function it worked perfectlt fine
